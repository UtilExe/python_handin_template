    "- Look at the activation_function and plot the y-values for each x from -5,5 spaced with 0.5\n",
    "- Change the perceptron method from the notebook to use the numpy.dot() method in line 12 instead of the lengthy sum() function\n",

    "### Part two: rodent data\n",
    "- Make a new scatter plot with datapoints of weights vs heights. Choose different colors for rats and mice\n",
    "- Manually find the optimal linear function to divide the 2 groups (y = aX+b). Plot it on the scatter plot\n",
    "- What is the slope and intercept of the linear function?\n",
    "- Now change the 'type' column to represent rats as 1 and mice as -1\n",
    "- Clean up any rows with null data\n",
    "- Use these weights her√® [40,-190] to determine if the following 3 animals are mice or rats:\n",
